## About

A web app that provides users with personally curated recipe suggestions powered by AI. This app explores Next.js for its full-stack capabilities and API routing, React Query for efficient data fetching, and custom hooks. Built with TypeScript for type safety and Zustand for state management, with recipe suggestions generated through the OpenAI API, and styling with Tailwind. 

## Technologies
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Zustand

**Note: This app is still a work in progress. Right now, only the recipe name and a short description are generated. Eventually, the user should be able to view and save recipes, and shuffle new recipes too. I also want to add auth to store the user's ingredients and favorited recipes.**
